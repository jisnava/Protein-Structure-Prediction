# Protein-Structure-Prediction
A Template-Based protein structure prediction which generates low resolution protein structures.
#Files description: 
Changer.py- fixes missing atoms and eliminate duplicate records,
downloadPDB.py-is used to download pdb files from RCSB-PDB, where the filenames are already given in a list,
amino.py- a dictionaries of basic amino acid names, their single letter codes and their standard atoms,
LibGenerator2.py- code for generating library files of length two,
psp_mainchain_only.py-code for predicting protein structure from FASTA sequence,


#Important:
Proper setting of path variables are important for running the code correctly.
